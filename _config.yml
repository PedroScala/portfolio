  <b><span style='font-size: larger;'>Data Analyst</span></b><br />
  
  I am a dedicated Data Analyst with a passion for translating information into valuable insights that drive business success. 
  Holding a degree in Chemical Engineering from FEI and an MBA in Data Science & Analytics from USP/ESALQ, I bring over four years of experience in handling data for companies of diverse scales. 
  My journey into data analysis began as a researcher during scientific initiation, where I recognized the significance of computational methods and scientific methodologies in effective problem-solving.
